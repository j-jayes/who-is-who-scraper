He was the son of landowner Carl Fredrik H. and Matilda Andersson. He married Elsa Bengtsson in 1918, and they had three children: Ella (born in 1919), Bengt (born in 1922), and Inga (born in 1932). Otto Holmqvist completed his secondary school studies in 1912, officer training in 1914, then studied at the Artillery and Engineering College (AIHS) from 1914 to 1917 before studying at the General Staff College (GCI) in 1920. He served as second lieutenant in the Göta Artillery Regiment in 1914, lieutenant in 1917, and was transferred to the Reserve in 1928; he became captain in 1929 and retired as major in the army in 1940. From 1924 to 1936, he was a technical manager for Götaälvdalens Omnibus A-B, and he owned and managed Sotared's estate in Älvsborg County.

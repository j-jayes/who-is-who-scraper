    "translated": "Carl Emanuel (Manne) Carlman was an architect and county architect from Halmstad. He was born on September 26, 1900 in Ljungby to parents Willehad C. and Elin Carlman. He married Hedvig Lindberg in 1936 and they had five children: Eva (born 1937), UlHia (born 1939), B^ertil! (born 1942), Anna (born 1944), and Inga (born 1947). \n\nHe attended Kalmar high school in 1917 and earned his mechanical engineering degree from Norrköping technical gymnasium in 1921. He then pursued shipbuilding studies at KTH from 1926 to 1928, where he graduated as an architect in 1933. He studied shipbuilding in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and North America from 1923 to 1925, as well as architecture in various countries such as Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Germany. \n\nIn 1933, he received a travel grant from KTH to study architecture and urban planning in the United States and Canada. In 1938, he received a travel grant from the Swedish King to study general planning and road problems as well as recreational areas in Europe. \n\nHe worked at A-B Götaverken in Gothenburg from 1922 to 1923 and as a motorman and engineer on steam and motor vessels from 1923 to 1925. He worked for Stockholm's Norrmalm planning council in 1933 and as a construction inspector in Stockholm from 1934 to 1935. He was an assistant county architect in Malmö and Kristianstad from 1936 to 1938, and a county architect in Kristianstad from 1938 to 1946. He then became a county architect in Halmstad, a position he held until retirement. \n\nHe was the chairman of KTH student union in 1928, and served as the dormitory superintendent from 1929 to 1930. He represented the Swedish Architects' Association during revisions of the health city ordinance in 1934, and served as the chairman of the Kristianstad engineering association from 1936 to 1938. He was a member of the board of the Society for Local History, and several other non-profit organizations. \n\nHe wrote articles for the Byggmästaren and Motor magazines and documented his travels. His hobbies included nature conservation, hunting, and fishing. He was awarded the Royal Order of the North Star, the Royal Order of Vasa, and the KTH student union's plaque of merit.",
